            <h2>Hurricane Beryl and JPS vs My Summer!</h2>
            <h4>September 30, 2024 by Dejone Watson</h4>

            <p>As we all know, this past summer was a time! I got to enjoy a fairly chill month of June! It was admittedly a little lonely, if I'm being honest, because my mom and little sister were out all day at school and my dad worked the farm then went up to the bar after. My mom was determined to make this a fun summer for us, given her intent to make sure I spend summer 2025 working my behind off on work and travel. Oh, the best laid plans of mice and men! </p>
            <p>And now, here comes Sir Beryl! I was stressed out, honestly! My parents were being weirdly nonchalant about it all, only stocking about the day before like crazy people. And wouldn't you know it, the family cat, Oz, somehow developed an abscess right before! Before the hurricane even hit, the ackee tree near my room gave up the ghost like a coward. We lost light in the 9 am and when I tell you, we didn't get it back for the next 17 DAYS! And we only got it because my dad had a friend who was apart of a contracting team who got them to come our way! Not to mention, literally right after, because they didn't restore the area where the pump was, within 24 hours, water finally ran out of our tanks. We only got to comfortably enjoy our summer again in late August! In time for one beach trip and us all going on my parent's aniversary date. On the bright side, I got some very cute pictures of my parents being dorky!</p>

            <h2>An Ode to Ghost Stories</h2>
            <!--This entry was written by my friend with an image sourced by me-->

            <p>The macabre may be menacing and distasteful for the general gent, but as a lover of the the dreary and subjects of the damned, it is not mere morbid fascination that grips me, now the cheap thrill of a jumpscare on screen. No, what is truly remarkable when it comes to the strange and sinister...is that it is a mere reflection on what we value and fear as a society. The oldest ghost stories have dated back to Mesopotamia, depicting demons that arise from improper burials. This may be an insight to primitive beliefs and machinations of illness and plague resulting from a rotting corpse fouling the fields and crops.  Renaissance Europe ghost stories depict warnings to those who have strayed from the teachings of religion, as a reflection of a society where the king and church were intertwined. </p>
            <p>So nowadays, where does that leave our modern ghost stories? Tales of restless spirits after horrific accidents and injustices, now mere cinematic cash-grabs of demons lurking in the dark? Our common people have commoditized and commercialized what we have feared. It's interesting to think, no? Our society is encased in capitalistic venture-- not even our monsters can escape.</p>
